Let's have a look at solved examples to understand geometry Formulas better.

Solved Examples Using Geometry Formulas
Example 1: Calculate the circumference and the area and of a circle by using geometry formulas if the radius of the circle is 21 units?

Solution:

To find the area and the circumference of the circle:

Given: Radius of a circle = 21 units
Using geometry formulas for circle,
Area of circle = π×r2 
= 3.142857 × 212
= 1385.44
Now for the circumference of the circle,
Using geometry formulas for circle,
Circumference of a Circle = 2πr
= 2(3.142857)(21)
= 131.95

Answer: The area of a circle is 1385.44 sq. units and the circumference of a circle is 131.95 units.

Example 2: What is the area of a rectangular park whose length and breadth are 60m and 90m respectively?

Solution:
To find the area of a rectangular park:

Given: Length of the park = 60m

The breadth of the park = 90m
Using geometry formulas for rectangle,

Area of Rectangle = (Length × Breadth)

= (60 × 90) m2 

= 5400 m2

Answer: The area of the rectangular park is 5400 m2.

Example 3: Using geometry formulas of the cube, calculate the surface area and volume of a cube whose edge is 6 units respectively?

Solution:
To Find: The surface area and volume of a cube whose edge is 6 units

Using geometry formulas of cube,
Surface area of cube is = A = 6a2
A = 6 (6)2
A = 6 × 36 = 216 units2
Volume of a cube, V = a3
V = (6)3
V = 216 units3 

Answer: The surface area of the cube is 216 units2. The volume of the cube is 216 units3
